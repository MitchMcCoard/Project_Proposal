# (3 points) Examine the characteristics of the dependent variable that
# you’ll be training a model to predict. Look at the distribution and

# you’ll likely need to account for as you build your model(s). Include one
# or more visualizations to illustrate the most important takeaway(s).

# (4 points) Summarize the characteristics of the remaining variables in the
# dataset at a high level. This should include any relevant groupings of like
# variables, a description of the number of categorical vs. continuous variables,
# any relevant patterns of missingness or odd distributions, etc. This should not
# be a long, comprehensive section of your report. What we’re looking for here is
# a high-level sketch of the dataset so that, in a page or two, the reader can get
# an idea of the data that you’ll be using and anything in particular that you’ll
# need to watch out for as you progress to building your model.
# (Note that, even though I’m asking for just a page or two of column summary, 
#   your team will likely need to look fairly carefully at each of the columns in 
#   order to identify any lurking issues and know which columns to highlight, etc.)
